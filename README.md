# micrblog-demo

I built a super bare-bones Twitter clone, basically. Thereâ€™s no replying and no logging in but posts can be created and deleted and can be displayed by user or all together in a timeline. I primarily went off the LogRocket blog post to create the API using node.js, PostgreSQL, TypeScript, and Express, and then built a simple static HTML page (with compiled TypeScript) to display and modify the backend database using API calls.
